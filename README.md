# MBBS-v10
Official repo for The Major BBS v10

More to come as the code gets released here.

## Issues Tab:
These are for issues relating to The Major BBS - Ideas, Issues/Bugs, Needs, etc.

The issue tracker is for capturing tickets that the Major BBS project team can use to plan out the project's work. The team wants to gather issue tickets that represent bugs, change or minor need requests, and ideas. 

**Do not put tickets related to modules that have a repository somewhere else. Use the Issues section of the module's repository for those.**

## How to report issues

Start the title of the github issue with the following prefixes so we know what's what:

**Request:**   - for change or minor need requests. Place as much detail as you can in the ticket.

**Idea:**      - for things that might be larger in scope or aren't a "story" but more of an "epic", or ideas that are not well-defined yet!

**Bug:**       - for things that are a defect and need fixing. Place as much detail as you can in the ticket, including attaching logs, screen shots, output from network or other tools, etc. 

Thank you!
